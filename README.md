## Ferrari F1 2025 - Strategy Analysis Project
### BDM-Project-Ferrari-Strategy_Analysis
This is a F1 Strategy Analysis project on the legendary Ferrari Team. This repository contains a comprehensive data-driven study of Scuderia Ferrari’s race performance, focusing on tire management, pit stop strategies, and driver telemetry during five critical Grands Prix of the 2025 season.

### About This Project
Ferrari, one of the most iconic teams in Formula 1, entered the 2025 season with high expectations but faced notable challenges translating qualifying speed into strong race results. This project dives deep into how tire degradation and strategic decisions shaped their performance relative to rivals like McLaren and Mercedes. Using rich, secondary data extracted via the FastF1 Python package, including lap times, stint details, tire compounds used, and telemetry data from Ferrari's drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, the analysis uncovers where and why Ferrari lost ground during races, and how strategy and execution can be improved.

### What’s Inside?
Data: Cleaned race lap and stint data for Ferrari, McLaren, and Mercedes across five races — Monaco, Imola, Suzuka, Silverstone, and Spa.
Telemetry: Detailed Ferrari telemetry data (speed, throttle, brake, gear) for both drivers at those races.
Visuals: Over 50 graphs including lap time trends, tire degradation curves, pit stop timelines, and telemetry speed traces.
Scripts: Python scripts used to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

### Key Insights
Ferrari’s race lap times degrade faster than key rivals during stints, primarily due to tire management and setup factors.
The team tends to use reactive rather than proactive pit strategies, often mirroring competitors rather than exploiting strategic windows.
Telemetry data reveals driver adjustments caused by tire wear affecting pace consistency.
Strategic recommendations include shortening medium tire stints, prioritizing harder compounds for longer runs, and integrating real-time telemetry for better in-race decisions.

### How to Use This Repository
Explore the Data: Find raw and processed CSV files in the data/ directory by team and race.
Run the Scripts: Use the provided Python scripts to replicate or extend analyses.
View the Visualizations: Check the summaries/ folder for graphs and telemetry plots that illustrate key findings.
Contribute: Feel free to suggest improvements, add new visualizations, or refine the models.

#### Data Source
All race and telemetry data were accessed using the open-source FastF1 Python package, which provides authentic session-level data sourced directly from official Formula 1 timing systems.

### Why This Matters
Formula 1 is a sport where subtle data insights and split-second strategic calls often define victory and defeat. By combining secondary data with driver telemetry, this project showcases how deep analysis can pinpoint performance bottlenecks and help teams like Ferrari transform speed potential into consistent success.
